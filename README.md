Examples of OpenAI API functionality using Java

## Chat Completion

This example demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API for chat completions in Java.

### Description

The `ChatCompletion` class sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a chat completion. In this example, we provide a system message and a user message, and the API responds with a completion of the conversation. This can be useful for implementing conversational AI systems or chatbots.

## Requirements 

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* OpenAI API key (from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
